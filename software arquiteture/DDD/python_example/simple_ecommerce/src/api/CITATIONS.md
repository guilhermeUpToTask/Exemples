The grandfather of patterns for connecting the UI to the application and domain layers is MODEL-
VIEW-CONTROLLER (MVC). It was pioneered in the Smalltalk world back in the 1970s and has
inspired many of the UI architectures that followed. Fowler (2002) discusses this pattern and several
useful variations on the theme. Larman (1998) explores these concerns in the MODEL-VIEW SEP-
ARATION PATTERN, and his APPLICATION COORDINATOR is one approach to connecting the
application layer.

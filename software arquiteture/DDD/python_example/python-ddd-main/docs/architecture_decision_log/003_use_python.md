# 3.  Use .NET Core and C# language

Date: 2021-05-25

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As it is monolith, only one language must be selected for implementation.

## Decision

We decided to use Python 3.9 as it is the newest stable Python release at the moment of writing this document. The choice of web framework is deferred at this point.

## Consequences

- Whole application will be implemented in Python
